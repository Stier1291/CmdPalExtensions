# Powertoys Command Palette Extensions
My first attempt to create more or less useful CmdPal extensions!

## Extensions
<table><thead>
  <tr>
    <th>Extension</th>
    <th>Description</th>
  </tr></thead>
<tbody>
  <tr>
    <td>Remote Desktop</td>
    <td>Easily connect to a remote desktop (mstsc.exe) with just entering an ip address.</br>Search term is just threatened as arguments for mstsc.exe. So just start with an ip address ('/v:' is automatically applied) and add as many command line args as needed.</br>Ctrl+Enter connects as admin session, means command line arg '/admin' will be applied.</td>
  </tr>
</tbody>
</table>
